# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. 
The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products.
Our stakeholders want to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset. 
The dataset chosen is for watches on Amazon.

## Results

- There are 47 vine reviews and 8362 non-Vine.

- The total 5 star vine reviews is 15 while the total for non-Vine is 4332.

- 31% of vine reviews were 5 stars while 51% of non-Vine were 5 star ratings.

## Summary

There does not seem to be a positivity bias when looking at the results because the average for paid reviews is around 3 stars.
Also the 5 star ratings are in the 75th percentile meanwhile 5 star ratings are in the 50th percentile. An additional analysis that
can be done is to plot a box and whiskers graph.
